Last Sunday my creative styling friend Jason (while my 2 loves Luke and Orson partied on at home) and I loaded up his trusty Tarago full of old crates and ladders, painted gold pears, pineapples, stacks of flowers, and photos of my hair creations and headed on down to St Lucia for the [Vintage Bride Wedding Fair](http://vintagebridemag.com.au/vintage-bride-wedding-fair-brisbane-15th-february-wrap-up/).

It was an amazing opportunity to showcase Bekki Brooker Hair with many other like-minded wedding peeps and not to mention the wonderful brides to be. If you are reading this blog, you're in the wedding field (whatever it may be), and considering doing a fair… I say go for it!!!!

I mean, find one that fits your niche, get creative with your booth, and be real to who you are. This being my first ever experience doing anything like this, all I can say is… WOOHOO! The lead up can be a little daunting and it's a big day but it's worth it. The brides I did get to talk to were super excited and just seeking some old fashioned advice. That's why I wanted to try a gig like this out! If you know your stuff and you love it, that will naturally ooze out of you. Being a little introverted, bombarding people is not my forte. But if you find your own groove and rock it, that's all you need.

The other epically creative and talented vendors that I did have the chance to chat with were all so supportive and happy to give me, the new kid on the block, some really great tips. I seriously appreciated everyone around my little booth and got to meet some crazily talented people! Overall it was an insane day (a good insane). I’m so thankful for the Vintage Bride Wedding Fair staff for putting on such top event and for all the awesome brides to be for rocking on down and checking out what Brisbane has to offer. And boy is there some good things on offer! All round thumbs up :)
